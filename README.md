Introduction

Retail sales prediction is crucial for inventory management, financial planning, and marketing strategies. This project aims to build a robust model to predict daily sales using historical sales data.
Problem Statement

The goal is to forecast daily sales for a retail store using historical sales data, considering factors like customer behavior, product attributes, and external influences.
Data Collection

    Dataset: Customer Shopping Dataset
    Source: Kaggle
    Description: The dataset includes customer ID, date, product, quantity, price, and total amount spent.

Data Preprocessing

    Handling missing values.
    Managing outliers.
    Converting data types.
    Normalizing/standardizing data.

Exploratory Data Analysis

    Visualization of sales trends.
    Analysis of seasonal patterns.
    Customer segmentation insights.

Feature Engineering

    Creating features for date (day, month, year).
    Generating lagged features for time series analysis.
    Encoding categorical variables.

Model Development

    Models tested: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, LSTM.
    Implementation details and code snippets provided.

Model Evaluation

    Metrics: RMSE, MAE.
    Comparison of model performances.

Hyperparameter Tuning

    Techniques: Grid Search, Random Search.
    Tuning results and optimal parameters.

Deployment

    Deployment using Flask.
    Creating an API for real-time sales prediction.

Results

    Final model performance metrics.
    Visualizations of actual vs. predicted sales.

Conclusion

    Summary of findings.
    Impact on retail forecasting.

Future Work

    Suggestions for model improvement.
    Potential extensions and additional features.
