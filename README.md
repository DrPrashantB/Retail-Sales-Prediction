## Introduction
Retail sales prediction is crucial for inventory management, financial planning, and marketing strategies. This project aims to build a robust model to predict daily sales using historical sales data.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to forecast daily sales for a retail store using historical sales data, considering factors like customer behavior, product attributes, and external influences.

## Data Collection
- **Dataset**: Customer Shopping Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehmettahiraslan/customer-shopping-dataset/data)
- **Description**: The dataset includes customer ID, date, product, quantity, price, and total amount spent.

## Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values.
- Managing outliers.
- Converting data types.
- Normalizing/standardizing data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualization of sales trends.
- Analysis of seasonal patterns.
- Customer segmentation insights.

## Feature Engineering
- Creating features for date (day, month, year).
- Generating lagged features for time series analysis.
- Encoding categorical variables.

## Model Development
- Models tested: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, LSTM.
- Implementation details and code snippets provided.

## Model Evaluation
- Metrics: RMSE, MAE.
- Comparison of model performances.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
- Techniques: Grid Search, Random Search.
- Tuning results and optimal parameters.

## Deployment
- Deployment using Flask.
- Creating an API for real-time sales prediction.

## Results
- Final model performance metrics.
- Visualizations of actual vs. predicted sales.

## Conclusion
- Summary of findings.
- Impact on retail forecasting.

## Future Work
- Suggestions for model improvement.
- Potential extensions and additional features.
